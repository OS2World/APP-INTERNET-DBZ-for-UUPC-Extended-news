I have uploaded to ftp-os2.nmsu.edu, in the incoming directory, 
UUDBZ003.ZIP.  A DBZ-type of program is usually required for
those who wish to run NoCEM on their machines.  This is a bug-fix for 
the logging mechanism, plus some minor improvements for users and
programmers. 

Also included is a patched version of expire.exe, designed to keep
expire from trying to delete articles that do not exist, which will
happen, esp. on machines running NoCEM on spool.

Requires emx runtime and UUPC/Extended 1.12s (it should work with
1.12r, but it has not been tested).

This is, most likely, the last version I will put out, as it appears
to have all of the serious bugs fixed.

From the change log:

 * Change log:
 *
 * Version .003:
 *
 * 11 Aug 97:  Finally got around to fixing the dbz log so that it
 *             actually writes to "Spool\dbz.log" instead of the
 *             default "UUPC\extended.log".  Improved logging so
 *             that debug level 5 will log all of the transactions
 *             that dbz could/could not make.
 *
 * Version .002:
 *
 * 9 Aug 97:   Added lock file mechanism so program would not run when
 *             UUXQT is already running.  Changed and added more exit
 *             codes:  1 means not found (-x and -m switches only).
 *             A "not found" for -m really means that it is not missing.
 *             When using -x, the program now spits back the key and the
 *             entries!  This is not a minor change, and may break some
 *             programs.
