 * Change log:
 *
 * Version .003:
 *
 * 21 Aug 97:
 *             Looks like the patched expire.exe is working now.
 *             By trying to fix the one bug, I accidently created
 *             another.  I redefined the stat buffer as a nonpointer,
 *             which keeps it from crashing.  Now, I just need to
 *             test it out for a few days to make sure it actually
 *             solves the problem.
 *
 * 11 Aug 97:  Finally got around to fixing the dbz log so that it
 *             actually writes to "Spool\dbz.log" instead of the
 *             default "UUPC\extended.log".  Improved logging so
 *             that debug level 5 will log all of the transactions
 *             that dbz could/could not make.
 *
 * Version .002:
 *
 * 9 Aug 97:   Added lock file mechanism so program would not run when
 *             UUXQT is already running.  Changed and added more exit
 *             codes:  1 means not found (-x and -m switches only).
 *             A "not found" for -m really means that it is not missing.
 *             When using -x, the program now spits back the key and the
 *             entries!  This is not a minor change, and may break some
 *             programs.
